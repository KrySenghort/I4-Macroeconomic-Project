# I5-Macroeconomic-Project

The global economy is intricately woven with the threads of macroeconomic dynamics and trade performance, each influencing the other in a continuous feedback loop. Here are several research question that we are going to explore the solution such following:
  - How do key macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation rate, and unemployment rate influence Cambodia’s international trade performance?
  - What is the relationship between exchange rate fluctuations and Cambodia’s trade balances?
  - To what extent do changes in international trade (imports and exports) impact Cambodia’s overall economic growth?
  - How do trade balances reflect the broader economic health of Cambodia in the context of its macroeconomic indicators?
  - What are the short-term and long-term effects of macroeconomic shocks on Cambodia’s trade performance?
